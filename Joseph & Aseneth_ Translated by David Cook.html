And the top storey had ten rooms in it. 3. The first room was large and pleasant; and it was paved with purple stones, and its walls were faced with precious stones of different kinds. 4. And the ceiling of that room was of gold; and within it <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes2"><font size="2"><font color="DarkBlue">[1]</font></font></a> were ranged the innumerable gods of the Egyptians, in gold and silver. 5. And Aseneth worshipped all these; and she feared them and offered sacrifices to them. <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes2"><font size="2"><font color="DarkBlue">[2]</font></font></a> 6. The second room contained all <i>the finery for</i> Aseneth's adornment and <i>treasure chests</i>. <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes2"><font size="2"><font color="DarkBlue">[3]</font></font></a> 7.

The third room contained all the good things of the earth; <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes2"><font size="2"><font color="DarkBlue">[5]</font></font></a> and it was Aseneth's store-house. 10. And seven virgins had the remaining seven rooms, one each. 11. And they used to wait on Aseneth, and were of the same age as she was, for they were all born on the same night as Aseneth; and they were very beautiful, like the stars of heaven, and no man or boy had ever had anything to do with them. 12. And Aseneth's large room, where she spent her time, <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes2"><font size="2"><font color="DarkBlue">[6]</font></font></a> had three windows. 13. One window looked out over the courtyard to the east: the second looked to the north, onto the street; and the third to the south. 14. And a golden bed stood in the room, facing the east. 15. And the bed had a coverlet of purple woven with gold, embroidered with blue, and fine linen. 16. In this bed Aseneth used to sleep alone, and no man or woman ever <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes2"><font size="2"><font color="DarkBlue">[7]</font></font></a> sat upon it, except Aseneth only. 17. And there was a great court all round the house, and a wall round the court, very high <i>and</i> built of great rectangular stones. 18. And there were four gates to the court, overlaid with iron; and eighteen strong young men-at-arms used to guard each one of them. 19. And along the wall inside the court every kind of beautiful tree that produces fruit had been planted; and the fruit on every one of them was ripe, for it was harvest time. 20. And on the right of the court there was an ever-bubbling <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes2"><font size="2"><font color="DarkBlue">[8]</font></font></a> spring of water, and beneath the spring a great cistern <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes2"><font size="2"><font color="DarkBlue">[9]</font></font></a> that received the water from the spring <i>and</i> out of which a river flowed through the middle of the court and watered all the trees in it.</p>

And after this she took the ashes and poured them out on the floor. 16.

It is worth noting, however, that Battifol's much fuller text, not only makes no mention of a shell, but also leaves no room for doubt that Aseneth's purpose in sending for the water was to 'wash her face', and that it was only when she saw her reflection in the water that she desisted ('Lest I wash off this great and welcome beauty'). </a></font></font><a name="Notes18"> </a></blockquote>

And his servants whispered in his ear, "Lo, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, the maidservants of Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wives, hate Joseph and Aseneth and are jealous of them, and they will do what you want." 3. And Pharaoh's son sent messengers <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[1]</font></a> and summoned them, and they came to him by night; and Pharaoh's son said to them, "I have heard <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[2]</font></a> that your are good soldiers." 4. And Gad and Dan, the elder brothers, said to Pharaoh's son, "Let our lord tell his servants what it is he wants, and he will do it." <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[3]</font></a> 5.And Pharaoh's son was overjoyed, and he said to his servants, "Go away and leave us alone, for I have something to say to these men privately." 6. And all the servants went out; and Pharaoh's son told them lies, saying, "I offer you a choice between prosperity and death: <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[4]</font></a> so choose prosperity <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[5]</font></a> and not death. 7. I know that you are good soldiers, and <i>that</i> you will not die as women <i>die</i>; but act like men and take vengeance on <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[6]</font></a> your enemies. 8. I heard" (he continued <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[7]</font></a> ) "your brother Joseph say to my father Pharaoh, 'Dan and Gad are the children of maidservants <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[8]</font></a> and are not my brothers. 9. And I am only waiting for my father to die to take action against them and all their progeny, so that they will not share the inheritance with us, for they are the children of maidservants, and it was they who sold me to the Ishmaelites. 10. When my father is dead I will repay them for the wrong they did me.' 11. And my father Pharaoh commended Joseph and said to him, <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[9]</font></a> 'What you have said is quite right, <i>my</i> son; and now <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[10]</font></a> take some of my soldiers <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[11]</font></a> and proceed against them as they did against you, and I will help you.'" 12. And when the men heard what Pharaoh's son told them they were much <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[12]</font></a> troubled and distressed, and they said to him, "We appeal to you, <i>our</i> lord, to help us; and whatever you tell your servants to do, we will do it." 13. And Pharaoh's son said to them, "To-night I will kill my father, for my father Pharaoh is like <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[13]</font></a> a father to Joseph; and <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[10]</font></a> do you also kill Joseph, <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[14]</font></a> and I will marry Aseneth." 14. And Dan and Gad said to him, "We will do everything you have told us to. We overheard Joseph say to Aseneth, 'Go to-morrow to our country estate, for it is vintage-time; and he has arranged for six hundred armed soldiers to go with her and fifty outrunners." <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[15]</font></a> 15. And when Pharaoh's son heard this, he <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[16]</font></a> gave the four men five hundred men each and appointed them their officers and commanders. 16. And Dan and Gad said to him, <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[17]</font></a> "We will go by night and lie in wait at the brook and hide in the woods on the banks. <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[18]</font></a> 17. And as for you, take fifty men with you, archers on horseback, and go on ahead, <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[19]</font></a> some distance in front; and Aseneth will come and fall into our <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[20]</font></a> hands, <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[21]</font></a> and we will cut down the men who are with her. <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[22]</font></a> 18. And Aseneth will flee in her chariot and fall into your hands and you will <i>be able to</i> deal with her as you wish. 19. And afterwards we will kill Joseph while he is fretting about Aseneth; and we will kill his children before his eyes." 20. And Pharaoh's son was delighted when he heard this, and he sent two thousand soldiers after them. 21. And they came to the brook and hid in the woods on the banks, and five hundred men took up their position in front; and in between them was a highway. <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes24"><font size="2">[23]</font></a></p>

And Benjamin advanced upon him <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[2]</font></a> and took hold of his sword <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[3]</font></a> and drew it from its scabbard (for Benjamin had no sword of his own with him). 3. And as he was about to strike Pharaoh's son, Levi rushed up and seized him by the hand and said, "No brother, you must not do this, for we are men who worship God, and it is not right for a man who worships God to repay evil for evil, or to trample upon a man who has <i>already</i> fallen, or to harry his enemy to death. 4. But come: let us bind up <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[4]</font></a> his wound; and if he lives, he will be our friend, and his father Pharaoh will be our father." 5. And Levi raised Pharaoh's son up and washed the blood off his face and bound a bandage round his wound; and he set him on his horse and took him to his father. 6. And Levi told him everything that had happened. 7. And Pharaoh got up <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[5]</font></a> from his throne and made obeisance to Levi upon the ground. <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[6]</font></a> 8. And on the third day Pharaoh's son died from the wound of Benjamin's stone. <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[7]</font></a> 9. And Pharaoh mourned for his eldest son, <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[8]</font></a> and he was worn out with grief. 10. And Pharaoh <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[9]</font></a> died at <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[10]</font></a> the age of one hundred and nine; and he left his crown <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[11]</font></a> to Joseph. 11. And Joseph was king of Egypt for <a href="http://www.markgoodacre.org/aseneth/translat.htm#Notes29"><font size="2">[10]</font></a> forty-eight years. 12. And after this Joseph gave the crown to Pharaoh's grandson; and Joseph was like a father to him in Egypt.</p>
