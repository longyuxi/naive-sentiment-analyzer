Concerning Symmachus. In the time of Verus there was a certain Symmachus, a Samaritan, of their wise men, but unhonored by his own people. He was afflicted with the lust for power and became angry with his tribe. He approached the Jews, became a proselyte, and was circumcised a second time. Do not be surprised at this, O hearer, for it occurred. For all who fled from the Jews to the Samaritans were likewise circumcised again; likewise also those who came from the Samaritans to the Jews did the same. And, moreover, what is even more difficult than these things, some of the circumcised became uncircumcised. By a certain operation of the medical art, by means of a knife called the spathistaros, the inner skin of the organ having been cut loose and sewed together and bound in place by adhesive medicaments, they again complete foreskins for them. You have also the testimony of the holy apostle, O great lover  of the good, speaking in such words as these: "If a circumcised man be called, let him not change to a foreskin; if a man be in uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised." This tradition of a demoniacally wicked notion they say that Esau, the brother of Jacob, invented for the denial of the Godhead and the obliteration of the characteristic mark of his fathers. Therefore they say that God said: "Esau I have hated, but I have loved Jacob." So this Symmachus, translating in order to pervert the translation current among the Samaritans, published the third translation.
